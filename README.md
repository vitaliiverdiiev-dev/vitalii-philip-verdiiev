🌍 Personal Web Page
Welcome to my personal web page — a minimalist, fully responsive site built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a central hub for everything I do:

💻 React Engineering – portfolio, projects, and coding philosophy

🎧 Sound & Audio Engineering – mixing, mastering, and gear

🌱 Life & Inspiration – books, films, and personal values

This site reflects my identity, work ethic, and passions — built for performance, scalability, and personality. It’s SSR-ready, strongly typed (no any, ever), and designed to grow with me.

⚙️ Built from scratch to showcase clean architecture, strong typing, and emotional truth.
